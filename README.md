# OnyxCrypter
My attempt at creating a C++ crypter.

## What is this?
OnyxCrypter is a simple test to see how a stub loads an executable, I was rather curious so I tried to find out. I copied [DarkCrypter](https://github.com/darkspiderbots/DarkCrypter) and went from there. Its basically his code. This code can be used to learn more about how such programs work.

## Todo
* Add RunPE
* Remove file dropping
* Add encryption to the resources.
